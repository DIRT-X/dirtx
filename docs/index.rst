Repository Description
======================
Text


Software
~~~~~~~~

We use exclusively open-access and open-source software for the following purposes:

* Numerical modelling: `open TELEMAC <http://www.opentelemac.org/>`_
* Geospatial data processing: `QGIS`_
* Codes and algorithmic solutions: `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_

Moreover, we have a strong commitment to open-access publishing of any results. All codes and algorithms will be provided on publicly available git repositories and referenced on this website at the time of publishing.

Instructions for getting ready to use models, codes, and algorithms provided are available at the online learning platform `hydro-informatics.github.io <https://hydro-informatics.github.io/>`_, which represents the baseline for online teaching contents of IWS' `hydro-morphodynamics research group <https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/research/focal-points/lww_Hydromorphologie_en/>`_
